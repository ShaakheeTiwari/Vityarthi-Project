# 📄 Project Statement: Simple Console Expense Manager

## 🎯 1. Problem Statement

Many small-scale projects, personal budgets, and short-term financial goals often lack a simple, accessible tracking tool. Reliance on complex spreadsheet software or feature-heavy, proprietary mobile apps is often overkill for users who simply need quick, on-the-fly visibility into their immediate cash flow (Income vs. Expense). This creates a barrier to entry for casual users who need a non-intrusive, zero-cost, and terminal-based solution to monitor their finances without an internet connection or cloud service.

## 🌍 2. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a foundational, console-based application that efficiently handles the core mechanics of personal financial tracking.

### In Scope:
* **Transaction Management:** Implementing the ability to add and classify transactions as either Income or Expense.
* **Balance Calculation:** Maintaining and calculating the running net balance in real-time.
* **Reporting:** Providing a single, centralized screen for viewing the transaction history and the financial summary (Totals).
* **User Interface:** A strictly command-line (CLI) interface driven by a numerical menu.
* **Data Validation:** Basic validation to ensure amounts are numeric and positive.

### Out of Scope (Future Work/V2):
* Data persistence (saving data to a file like JSON or CSV).
* Editing or deleting existing transactions.
* Categorization beyond 'Income' and 'Expense' (e.g., 'Groceries', 'Rent').
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) or web interface.

## 🧑‍💻 3. Target Users

The application is designed for users who prefer simplicity, speed, and terminal environments.

* **Developers/Power Users:** Individuals accustomed to the command line who want a fast, lightweight tool without leaving their terminal.
* **Students/Personal Budgeters:** Users needing a straightforward way to track pocket money, semester costs, or short-term budget goals.
* **Hobbyists (e.g., Guitar Builders):** Individuals managing the finances of a single, defined project who need clarity on total cost versus budget.
* **Beginner Programmers:** Users looking for a simple, functional Python project to learn basic data structures and input/output.

## ✨ 4. High-Level Features

1.  **Menu-Driven Navigation:** A clear main menu (1: Add Income, 2: Add Expense, 3: View Summary, 4: Exit) for easy application control.
2.  **Simple Transaction Input:** Prompts for only the **amount** and a short **description** for rapid entry.
3.  **Real-time Summary:** The application immediately displays the **Total Income**, **Total Expense**, and the **Current Net Balance**.
4.  **Transaction History Display:** Lists all recorded transactions, showing the date, description, type, and amount.
5.  **Console Readability:** Utilizes color-coding (green for income, red for expense) for improved visibility in the terminal.
